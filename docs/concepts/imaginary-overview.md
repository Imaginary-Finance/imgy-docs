## Introduction
Imaginary is a framework for using an asset's value independently of the asset. 

The protocol mirrors an illiquid asset's value into external, liquid tokens. Called Issued Stablecoins.

Assets that may have long-term holding value, illiquid value, or inherently growing value can be locked within Imaginary, and without selling, have their value converted into stablecoins.

## Lockers/Lender
Lockers are where user's deposit their assets. There are specialized lockers for each supported asset. Each locker is tuned to accuratly obtain valuations of the particular asset on-demand.
