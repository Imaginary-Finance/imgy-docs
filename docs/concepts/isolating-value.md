Imaginary, as a framework, is centered around ->  supplying assets / lending value

### Isolating Value
Within the smaller blockchain market, the price of an asset is synonomous with the amount of currency one party would be willing to relinquish to obtain that asset.

Implemented with smart contracts, Imaginary plays the role of enabling assets to be isolated and that value manipulated. The smart contracts, acting as a sort of saftey deposit box, enfore rules upon the asset under certain conditions. For example, forcing the asset to remain illiquid while there is outstaind debt.

### Substitution

Effectively transfer the value of any array of assets into one generalized representation of value. 

the stablecoins substitute the illiquid asset's value within the liquid market 

(only proportional to the amount of stablecoins minted against the asset)
