## Protocol Architecture
Imaginary is made up of a couple different parts. A simple outline of the architecture can be found in the [Protocol Overview](./architecture/protocol-overview.md).

To learn more about the collateral and loans specifically, read into the [Lender/Lockers](./architecture/lenderlockers.md) or [Sovereign Lockers](./architecture/sovereignlocker.md).
