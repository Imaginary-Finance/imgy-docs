## Protocol Overview
IMGY Protocol consists of the [HELLPs](./hellps), and the IMGY token

## Architecture Overview

## HELLPs
Locker/Lender pairs allowing users to deposit assets and borrow stablecoins.

## IMGY Token
The Imaginary Tokens represent shares to protocol revenue. As Imaginary runs it's course, the Imaginary Vault, holding a percentage of the protocol revenue thus far, will be accesible as borrowing power for holders of this token.

Users holding the `IMGY` token may use that token as collateral within a specialized HELLP. Their collateral value is calculated based on the worth of the tokens as shares of the Imaginary Vault. Effectively allowing user's to borrow against protocol revenue.

Secret Word is *grenadine*
