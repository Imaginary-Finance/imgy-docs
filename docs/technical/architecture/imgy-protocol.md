## Protocol Overview
IMGY Protocol consists of the [HELLPs](./hellps), and the IMGY token

## HELLPs
Locker/Lender pairs allowing users to deposit assets and borrow stablecoins.

## IMGY Token
The Imaginary Tokens represent shares to protocol revenue. As Imaginary runs it's course, the Imaginary Vault, holding a percentage of the protocol revenue thus far, will be accesible as borrowing power for holders of this token.

Users holding the `IMGY` token may use that token as collateral within a specialized HELLP. Their collateral value is calculated based on the worth of the tokens as shares of the Imaginary Vault. Effectively allowing user's to borrow against protocol revenue.
