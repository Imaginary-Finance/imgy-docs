## Introduction

Imaginary is an abstracted lending model implemented within a system of automated algorithmic stablecoins.

In other words, you may temporarily convert hard-to-reach value-

> *ya know, the value just gathering dust in your wallet's assets*

yeah, convert it into stablecoins easy for sending, spending, or investing!

While a user's portfolio has its value tied up in different assets, the user may mint stablecoins against those assets to reallocate their portfolio's value without selling the assets.

Even further, interest bearing assets, or sub-contracted assets, can be used to create self-paying loans! Loans that *pay themselves off*.
