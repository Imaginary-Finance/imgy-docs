## Introduction

Imaginary is an asset-agnostic, automated stablecoin protocol. This means user's may deposit blockchain assets to borrow stablecoins at mind-bending interest rates.

In other words, you may temporarily convert an asset's value-

> *ya know, the value just gathering dust on your wallet's assets*

yeah, convert it into stablecoins easy for sending, spending, or investing!

While a user's portfolio has its value tied up in different assets, the user may mint stablecoins against those assets to reallocate their portfolio's value without selling the assets.

Even further, interest bearing assets, or sub-contracted assets, can be used to create negative interest-rate loans! (*loans that pay themselves off*)
